Majd Koshakji built the Sliding Tily app as an Open Source app. This app is provided by Majd Koshakji at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my app.

If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.


## Personal Data Collection

The app doesn't collect or use any personal information.

## Information Collection and Use

The app does not use any third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Links to Other Sites

This app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or apps.

### Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Because this app doesn't collect any personal information, the app doesn't make any distinction for any age group, so the app doesn't collect any identifiable information of children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
