Apple [announced](https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-march-25th-event-at-the-steve-jobs-theater/) a special event on March 25, in which they are [rumored]( https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-event-march-2019-news) to launch some kind of news subscription service and probably their long rumored TV subscription service.




While those are probably the main event, I'm not personally interested in these two subscription services for a couple of reasons:
If I'm going to pay for news, I'd rather pay the publishers directly without going through Apple and [the reportedly]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-chafe-at-apples-terms-for-subscription-news-service-11549998416) very high cut they're demanding, and none of the rumored Apple TV service shows currently seem like a must watch.
I'm not saying these two services are bad in any way, they'll probably be somewhat successful, just that I'm currently not interested in either.
However, this event doesn't have to be all about services, what I'm hoping for is some hardware:

## Refreshed AirPods

When the AirPods launched in late 2016, a lot of people made fun of how they looked and how easy they'd be to lose, however, once people got to use them they quickly got almost universally loved.
I consider the AirPods my favorite Apple device ever. Even though I don't have a very long history of Apple devices, the AirPods are one of the closest tech purchases I made to perfection. The sound was good enough, the convenience unrivaled and the battery life was great.
However, almost two years after I purchased them, the battery life has decreased dramatically. My left AirPod makes the battery low sound, one of the saddest sounds in the world, after almost an hour of podcast listening at about 70% volume, meaning I can't get through most podcast episodes I tend to listen to without charging.
There have been [repeated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-22/apple-is-said-to-plan-upgrades-to-popular-airpods-headphones) [rumors](https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/17/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-display-more/) of new AirPods with hands-free "Hey Siri", longer battery and the previously announced wireless charging case, and I really hope they get released this March, even if they don't release the long delayed AirPower.
While I love my AirPods, longer battery life is always welcome, I also hope they add some level of waterproofing that would eliminate the worry I have when wearing AirPods in the rain.
I really want to buy a new pair of AirPods, but can't get myself to pull the trigger when a refresh seems so close.

## 7th Generation iPad

Even though the iPad Pro gets all the love and attention of the tech crowd, I believe the 29 iPad is an incredible deal that should be the default suggestion for anyone looking to buy an iPad, at least anyone who already has a main computer that they get their work done on.
As an aspiring software developer, I still need my Mac to get most of my work done, which puts my iPad in a somewhat awkward place: it's, at the same time, the computer I need the least and the computer I want and love the most.
The 5th generation iPad I'm currently typing this on is a pretty awesome tablet, the screen is great, the performance is good and the battery life is still amazing, however, the iPad Pro line has me wishing for more.
When the 6th generation iPad was released, my iPad was only a few months old and I couldn't get myself to upgrade just for the Apple Pencil and the slight performance improvements.
What I would like to see in a new iPad is the [rumored](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/30/ipad-and-ipad-mini-coming-in-spring/) bigger display, which would be nice with an Apple Pencil, an improved camera and a upgraded processor.
While I don't use my iPad for taking pictures, sometimes it's convenient to be able scan documents with its camera using the built-in Notes document scanner, and with Apple trying to push ARKit, it would be nice to have a better camera.
Almost the same could be said about the processor: it doesn't _need_ much improvement, even my generation old iPad is still perfectly fine, I think they should push hard to decrease the performance gap between the iPad and iPad Pro lines, which could give developers the freedom to develop more powerful apps without having to worry much about how these apps would run on non-Pro iPads.
I don't think it's reasonable to assume we're going to get much else out of this generation of iPad, but I have one more thing that I would love to see: a Smart Keyboard.
The Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard were the most important differentiating features of the early iPad Pros, but now with the new design, FaceID, USB-C, and the Apple Pencil already being supported on the regular iPad, I don't think the keyboard is going to cannibalize the apparently solid sales of the iPad Pro, and it could be a nice bonus in education, were the regular iPad is more popular.

## Other Hardware
There have also been a few [rumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/14/apple-7th-generation-ipod-touch/) about old devices being revived, such as the iPad Mini and the iPod Touch, which haven't been updated in a while.
I'm not personally interested in either device but I hope Apple updates them both, and keeps their prices low, they are nice entry-level devices that could be some people's first experience with iOS, and I don't think Apple needs to invest that much to keep them relevant: they don't need the latest and greatest, a processor upgrade is almost all they need in order for them to fit  their roles reasonably fine.

--------
Apple is probably going to focus more on their services in this event, but that doesn't mean they can't launch some new hardware: all of my wishes are basically minor updates that don't require that much stage time.
