# Sliding Tily

Today, I'm launching my first app to the app store.
It's a little game called Sliding Tily, or just Tily for short.

This game is a sliding tile puzzle game with a small number of levels, and a few search algorithms that can solve each level with varying levels of efficiency, including:

- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Unified-Cost Search
- Hill Climbing (pure heuristic search)
- A-Star (A*)

The goal of the game is to move the main tile (colored in red) to the rightmost bottom position, in the lowest number of moves.

The whole game is open source and you can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/koshakji/tily).

I know it's not a huge game, it started out as a university project, but I thought it would be fun to release to the App Store, alongside the code implementing some common search algorithms in a way that's generelizable to other [state space search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search) problems, which may be helpful to someone learning those algorithms.

You can check it out [here](). I hope you enjoy it!
