I’m hoping to publish here more often than I have since I started this blog, so in this post I’m going to try to explain how I do things in general.
I don’t have the most interesting setup, I just think it’s worth sharing for future reference because I always feel I can understand why people ask for specific features or complain about different technology issues if I know how they use the stuff they use, software and hardware.


The details of this post are inspired by some questions from [lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/)’s [How I Work](https://lifehacker.com/c/how-i-work) series, which I enjoyed reading for many years, and [episode 464](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/464) of the awesome [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/mpu) podcast, where [David Sparks](http://macsparky.com/) interviewed [Stephen Hackett](https://512pixels.net) before Stephen joined him as his cohost about all kinds of things, including how he works.


## About me
I’m a student in University of Damascus, Information Technology Engineering department, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I work on a bunch of iOS apps in my free time, hoping to release something to the App Store in the near future.

## Hardware
I have an early 2015 MacBook Pro 13 inch with Retina Display, with a 3.1GHz 5th Generation Core i7 and 8GB of RAM. While it’s getting a little old, I really don’t want to deal with the new keyboard reliability issues, so I’m hoping it can survive long enough for Apple to make keyboards that work reliably again, otherwise I think I’d move to an iMac and try to use the iPad exclusively while away from home.

Speaking of the iPad: I have the new iPad Air, which is my favorite device to use, even though I can’t do all my work using it. I like the experience of using an iPad so much that I try to fit it into my workflow wherever possible, even if it’s not always the most efficient tool for the task, it’s more often than not the tool I prefer.

I mostly use my iPad without any accessory, but I also have a Logitech K380 bluetooth keyboard I use occasionally, and I’m hoping to buy an Apple Pencil soon.

My phone is an iPhone 7 Plus with a slowly dying battery. I used to use it more when it could last all day and before I bought this iPad, now I’m hoping I can afford whatever Apple releases in the next generation so I can finally upgrade (I think I’m going to be upgrade to the smaller non-Max version mostly for pricing reasons).

One thing that’s worth mentioning is that this MacBook Pro is my first Mac, and the phone is also my first iPhone. I used Linux previously on an old Lenovo laptop and an Android phone (HTC One M8). I switched platforms because I’m interested in developing mobile apps, I don’t like Java, and prefer the security and privacy policies of Apple over any Android phone company. I also wanted the iPhone’s camera and very much enjoyed the level of integration that using multiple Apple devices provides.

I also have a 4th generation Apple Watch I wear all the time, but don’t find very useful and I use a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ for a bunch of things, including a git server using [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/), a file server and some automations.

## Software
Over the past couple of months, I’ve moved more and more towards using the stock Apple provided apps for more things in my life. I use the default Safari, Notes, Reminders and iCloud extensively. They’re not always the most powerful apps, but they provide an experience that’s hard to match by 3rd party apps. Safari’s speed and low battery usage make it an obvious winner over Chrome for me. Notes is, in my opinion the best note taking app on any platform, it has almost all the features (tags please?) I can wish for without being bloated or slow, and it’s completely free!

Reminders is the hardest one of these to explain. I like try out task managers and I’ve sometimes used multiple apps at the same time, but lately I’ve settled on Reminders. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of an app like OmniFocus or even Todoist, it does have a few advantages, especially the new version in iOS 13, which I’ve been using. The integration with Siri is unparalleled, the sync is incredibly fast and the automation possibilities with apps like [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?uo=4) and [Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?uo=4) are endless.

Which brings me to automation. While the iOS ecosystem is not as open as the Mac, apps like [Pythonista](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?uo=4), [Jayson](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jayson/id1447750768?uo=4) and the aforementioned Scriptable and Shortcuts make some kinds of automations much easier and more fun to build. I’ll be sharing more of these automations as time goes by, they’re an essential part of my usage of the iPad and iPhone, including publishing to this website.

A couple of apps I’d like to mention are [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?uo=4) and [GoodNotes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602?uo=4). Working Copy is a great Git client for iOS which works with all the major git services including [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org), It also works with other self-hosted git servers like my Gitea server. GoodNotes is a note taking app, specifically geared toward handwriting and drawing. I use it extensively when thinking about programming problems or trying to explain a programming concept to someone else.
For entertainment, I use [Overcast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?uo=4) to listen to podcasts, [lire](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lire-full-text-rss/id550441545) for RSS, [Tweetbot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-5-for-twitter/id1018355599?uo=4) for Twitter, and [Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-save-read-grow/id309601447?uo=4) to read a whole bunch of articles every day.

One last category I’d like to talk about is text editors. I love text editors and use different editors for different tasks, or sometimes depending on my mood. A few that are worth mentioning: [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is incredibly fast and stable, [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is good looking and full featured, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is extensible and powerful, albeit somewhat slow.

I write Python and Ruby code in any one of these three editors regularly on my MacBook (I also use Xcode for iOS Development in Swift).

On the iOS side, I use [1Writer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1writer-markdown-text-editor/id680469088?uo=4) for posts like this (which are mostly written and published from my iPad), [Kodex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481?uo=4) for programming stuff, and sometimes write little snippets of code in Pythonista and [Swift Playgrounds](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?uo=4).

If it’s not obvious: I really like trying out new apps. I have more than 700 apps installed on my iPhone, most of them are not regularly used. I keep them installed to monitor their updates and play around with them from time to time. The apps I mentioned are just some of my favorite and most important apps, and not by any means an extensive list of apps I use regularly. More of those will come up as I write more here.
