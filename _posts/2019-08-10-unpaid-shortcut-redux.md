A few days ago, Dr. Drang wrote a [post](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2019/08/a-shortcut-for-reminders/) on his [website](https://leancrew.com/all-this/) explaining a Shortcut he put together to sum up the total of sent invoices.
It‘s a cool idea, the Shortcut utilized several regular expressions to figure out the invoiced amount from the title of a reminder which included multiple bits of information, formatted in a specific way.
After reading the post I thought the shortcut could be simplified by using a cool feature of the Magic Variable system in Shortcut, and the “Format Number” action.




The feature I’m referencing is the Repeat Results Magic Variable, as explained by Dr. Drang in a later [post](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2019/08/unpaid-shortcut-redux/) incorporating my suggestions:

> As is so often the case with Shortcuts, I underestimated the power of magic variables. The Repeat with Each loop creates a list on its own; with each pass through the loop, it adds the output of the last action within the body of the loop to that list. That magic variable, called Repeat Results, is the output of the loop.

Drang also mentioned the difficulties of creating idiomatic Shortcuts, I feel exactly the same way. It’s not easy to use everything Shortcuts has to offer, instead of using it like I’d use a regular programming language, but I’ve been getting better about this with time. This is an area where people learning Shortcuts without a programming background can have an advantage in getting used to all the features the app provides.

I cannot begin to describe how awesome it is to be mentioned by Dr. Drang on his website. A bunch of my own automations are inspired by his ideas, and it’s always a great read!
