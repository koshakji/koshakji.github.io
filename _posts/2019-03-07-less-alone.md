For a long while now, I've been thinking about starting a blog.
I always had an excuse though. "I need hosting", "I don't have a good domain name", "nobody will find/be interested in what I have to say" and other reasons not to start.

So, here I am. I still don't have any domain name, don't think this GitHub Pages hosting will be my permanent solution, and still don't think most people will ever find this, and if they did, they will most likely not be interested at all in reading what I, a random person, has to say about anything.





### Important note
I'm not a native English speaker, and I don't write much so the grammar and spelling mistakes are inevitable, so is the bad writing. You are welcome to send feedback [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/koshakji).

## Why am I doing this?
I have some thoughts, mostly about technology, programming, media and the NBA, and I would like to share them with anybody who's interested.

In October 2015, [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), the podcast client made by [Marco Arment](https://marco.org) became free. Back then I didn't listen to any podcast and didn't even know what podcasts were.
However, reading the [news]( https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/9/9486803/overcast-2-podcast-app-iphone-announced) that a nice podcast app went free compelled me check it out. I installed the app on my iPod Touch, which was my only iOS device at the time, and started playing around with it and found the [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm), a podcast also made by Marco, the app developer himself, and started listening.
At the time, I was a big tech nerd who just got into university expecting to find like-minded nerds and found almost none. I had grown up the weirdo who likes to spend more time on the internet than hanging out with friends and who sometimes talked about stuff nobody understood or cared about (surprisingly, nobody was interested in helping me pick which Linux distro to try next, or which task manager is better). None of my friends at the time were interested in the things I was interested in, so even though I had a bunch of friends, I felt alone.
Finding the Accidental Tech Podcast was, in a way, validation.
I was not alone. I was not the only person who cared about every little detail of my computing life, hardware and software. There were at least Marco, [Casey](https://www.caseyliss.com) and [John](https://twitter.com/siracusa). And then through listening I found out about [Relay fm](https://relay.fm), and so I found [Myke]( https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley), [Stephen](https://512pixels.net) and [Federico](https://www.macstories.net/author/viticci/) doing the awesome [Connected](https://relay.fm/connected) podcast, and the websites where Stephen and Federico write, [512 Pixels](https://512pixels.net) and [MacStories](https://macstories.net), respectively.
Relay also introduced me to many cool podcasts including [Cortex](https://relay.fm/cortex), [Upgrade](https://relay.fm/upgrade) and [Mac Power Users](https://relay.fm/mpu), and more awesome people who were guests on, or hosted shows I listened to, than I could count.
I felt like I have finally found people who care and think about the same stuff I cared about. Even though these people don't know me and haven't heard of me, they feel somewhat like my friends. I felt, and to this day, feel less alone because of that.

This is all a very long way to say what I hope to accomplish with this blog. Which is to, hopefully, make someone feel that same way, the way I felt when I knew there were others who had the same interests as I do and were publicly talking about it, less alone.
