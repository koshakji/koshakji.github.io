Congratulations to Federico Viticci and the incredible [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) team on this achievement!
Here's a bit Viticci wrote on the occasion that encapsulates what I love so much about this website:

> At some point by the end of 2012, I made the decision that we were going to stop reporting rumors or leaks and that chasing news stories to be "first" was no longer going to be our priority. I decided that I wanted MacStories to go back to its roots by prioritizing original reporting, editorials, and reviews over rehashing information that other websites were covering better than MacStories anyway.

Anyone can report on Apple news, but not many can do it with the [depth](https://www.macstories.net/tag/ios-reviews/) and [expertise](https://www.macstories.net/tag/shortcuts/) of Viticci and the team.
