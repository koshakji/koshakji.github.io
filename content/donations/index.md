- [Sofraa Gaza](https://chuffed.org/project/137288-ambassadors-of-gaza-sfraaa-ghz): a mutual aid initiative started by Gazans for Gazans which provides a diverse and expansive web of care and support for Palestinians all across Gaza, including distributing rice or flour meals, food parcels, cash parcels and fresh drinking water trucks. Ambassadors of Gaza aims to create a reliable and above all safe alternative for Palestinians to get their basic food and resources.
